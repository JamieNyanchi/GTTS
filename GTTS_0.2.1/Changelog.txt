Version 0.2.1 2017-07-01
------------------------

Excluded "god-controller" from modified prototypes due
to minimum speed issues causing error loading into
Factorio version 0.15.26 .

Version 0.2.0 2017-06-28
------------------------

Added a load of missing modifications to time ratios, in
particular changed accumulator Input and Output rates,
and fixed vehicle power consumption.

Moved the modifications from data-updates to
data-final-fixes as some mods change crafting speeds
in their data-updates, such as Angel's modifications
to Bob's MK 2 Chemical Plants.

Added a wild guess fluid speed modification. Since the
math beind fluid speeds is pretty obscured, and I don't
have a good way of testing it, use at your own risk.


Version 0.1.1 2017-06-27
------------------------

First release to mod portal as mod is stable, and many
of the initial goals are accomplished.


Version 0.1.0 2017-06-25
----------------------

Created mod base and modified a collection of speeds.
