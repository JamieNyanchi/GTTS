Version 1.2.0 2017-07-25
------------------------

Added per map options for adjusting values for pollution
enemy expansions, evolution, and hand crafting rates.

Changed train properties to more accurately adjust their
acceleration and collision damage.


Version 1.1.2 2017-07-25
------------------------

Added the following properties to be adjusted as power
rates used by roboports, solar panels, combinators,
and the rocket silo.

charging_energy
production
idle_energy_usage
lamp_energy_usage
active_energy_usage


Version 1.1.1 2017-07-24
------------------------

Made adjustments to the "heat_buffer" "max_trasfer"
property of nuclear reactors and heat pipes.


Version 1.1.0 2017-07-17
------------------------

Fixed the events related to changing the game speed
so that it properly updates the game speed when and
only when the mod settings have changed or the mod
or game is updated.

No longer adjusts the values of

request_to_open_door_timeout
flow_length_in_ticks

Due to problems at low target frame rates and the
minor ingame impact of these values.


Version 1.0.1 2017-07-16
------------------------

Small changes to readme, and removed nonfunctioning
option to immediately reset the game speed of a
running game.


Version 1.0.0 2017-07-16
------------------------

This mod now also adjusts the object weights and the
energy per hit point of collision damage in order to
properly adjust the kinetic energy of vehicles.

The mod also now adjusts mining and repair tool
durability which was based on ticks used.


Version 0.2.1 2017-07-01
------------------------

Excluded "god-controller" from modified prototypes due
to minimum speed issues causing error loading into
Factorio version 0.15.26 .


Version 0.2.0 2017-06-28
------------------------

Added a load of missing modifications to time ratios, in
particular changed accumulator Input and Output rates,
and fixed vehicle power consumption.

Moved the modifications from data-updates to
data-final-fixes as some mods change crafting speeds
in their data-updates, such as Angel's modifications
to Bob's MK 2 Chemical Plants.

Added a wild guess fluid speed modification. Since the
math beind fluid speeds is pretty obscured, and I don't
have a good way of testing it, use at your own risk.


Version 0.1.1 2017-06-27
------------------------

First release to mod portal as mod is stable, and many
of the initial goals are accomplished.


Version 0.1.0 2017-06-25
----------------------

Created mod base and modified a collection of speeds.
