Version 1.0.0 2017-07-16
------------------------

This mod now also adjusts the object weights and the
energy per hit point of collision damage in order to
properly adjust the kinetic energy of vehicles.

The mod also now adjusts mining and repair tool
durability which was based on ticks used.


Version 0.2.1 2017-07-01
------------------------

Excluded "god-controller" from modified prototypes due
to minimum speed issues causing error loading into
Factorio version 0.15.26 .

Version 0.2.0 2017-06-28
------------------------

Added a load of missing modifications to time ratios, in
particular changed accumulator Input and Output rates,
and fixed vehicle power consumption.

Moved the modifications from data-updates to
data-final-fixes as some mods change crafting speeds
in their data-updates, such as Angel's modifications
to Bob's MK 2 Chemical Plants.

Added a wild guess fluid speed modification. Since the
math beind fluid speeds is pretty obscured, and I don't
have a good way of testing it, use at your own risk.


Version 0.1.1 2017-06-27
------------------------

First release to mod portal as mod is stable, and many
of the initial goals are accomplished.


Version 0.1.0 2017-06-25
----------------------

Created mod base and modified a collection of speeds.
