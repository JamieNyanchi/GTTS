Mod by Zanthra (zanthra@gmail.com)

This mod's goal is to reduce the speeds of as many items in the game as
reasonable, and then increase the game speed to match the target frame rate
as set in the mod options. This will increase the updates per second, and
the draw fps, and restore the speed of modified objects. The goal is to
provide as close an experience as reasonably possible to standard factorio,
while allowing the game to be played at frame rates above 60, such as 120fps
for more comfortable viewing on high refresh rate displays.

This approach while possible has a few problems, first THIS MOD IS NOT YET
COMPLETE, there are a few more things that need to be adjusted before things
will start to look normal. Second, there are things that cannot be changed
by mods, such as the displayed length of time a train will wait at a train
station. If it says 120 seconds, then the game will respect the doubled game
speed, and send the train off at 60 seconds. Modified values are also
similarly affected. By reducing energy consumption by 1/2 along with crafting
speed by 1/2, the ammount of energy it takes to craft each item remains the
same, but it will appear, if you use the numbers presented in game, than
any given ammount of stored energy, either as fuel or in accumulators, would
seem like it should provide energy for twice as long. And naturally doing
math with the modified crafting speeds, but original crafting times would
give you a wrong indication of total crafts per second.
